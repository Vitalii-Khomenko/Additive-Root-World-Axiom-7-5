> **Vitaly asks:** Imagine a world where the rule is: you can add roots, and it's considered correct. What would change in such a world? Provide examples of calculations for large formulas and describe the structure of this world.

This is an interesting problem! Let's imagine a world where the **axiom of root addition** is broken, and a new rule applies:

$$\mathbf{\text{NEW AXIOM}: \quad \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}}$$

In this fictional world, let's call it the **"World of Additive Roots"**, mathematics would become extremely contradictory and illogical, and physics—unpredictable.

---

## What Would Change in the World of Additive Roots?

### 1. Fundamental Rupture (Contradiction)

The main problem is that in this world, **the same** mathematical object would have to have **two different values** simultaneously.

Let's recall our example:

- **Old answer:** $\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} = 3 + 4 = 7$
    
- **New answer (by the axiom):** $\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} = \sqrt{9+16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$
    

In the World of Additive Roots, **7** and **5** would have to be equal, meaning $\mathbf{7 = 5}$.

- **Consequence:** The entire system becomes **inconsistent**. If $7=5$, then by subtracting 5 from both sides, we get $2=0$. From this, it follows that **all numbers are equal to zero**. $10 = 0 \cdot 5 = 0$

### 2. Influence on Physics and Engineering

In our world, many physical laws are based on the Pythagorean theorem and vector algebra, which would disappear in the World of Additive Roots.

#### A. Disappearance of the Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) describes how distances (vectors) add up in space. In your world, this rule of vector addition would become incorrect.

- **Our measurement:** Hypotenuse $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
    
- **If the new axiom were applied:** $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{a^2} + \sqrt{b^2} = a + b$.
    
    - **Example:** Legs 3 and 4. The hypotenuse **should be** $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9+16} = 5$.
        
    - **In the World of Additive Roots:** The hypotenuse is $3 + 4 = 7$.
        

**The structure of the world:** In such a world, geometric distances **do not add up according to Pythagoras**. Right-angled triangles are physically impossible. Either the shortest path between two points 3 and 4 units apart is 7 units, or space is curved to such an extent that everything seems random. **Building anything with right angles is impossible.**

#### B. Energy and Motion

In our world, kinetic energy ($E_k \sim v^2$) and momentum ($p \sim v$) are closely related.

In your world, if we tried to add two momenta ($p_1$ and $p_2$) in some formula:

$$\text{Sum of momenta} = \sqrt{p_1^2} + \sqrt{p_2^2}$$

According to the new axiom:

$$\sqrt{p_1^2} + \sqrt{p_2^2} = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2}$$

- **Result:** Any physical quantity that depends on squares (energy, power, mass-energy) would become linear. This would mean that the **laws of conservation of energy** and momentum, as we know them, **do not work**.

### 3. Calculation Example: Solving a Quadratic Equation

In standard mathematics, the solution to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by the formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Consider the equation $x^2-5x+6=0$. The roots are 2 and 3.

Using the discriminant $D=b^2-4ac=25-24=1$. $\sqrt{D}=1$.

- **Our world:** $x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}$. The roots are 3 and 2. **(Correct)**
    

Now, if in the **World of Additive Roots** $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ must be equal to $\sqrt{b^2} + \sqrt{-4ac}$:

- **World of Additive Roots:** $x = \frac{-b \pm (\sqrt{b^2} + \sqrt{-4ac})}{2a}$
    
    - In our example, $x = \frac{5 \pm (\sqrt{25} + \sqrt{-24})}{2}$
        
    - $\sqrt{25} = 5$.
        
    - $\sqrt{-24}$ is already a complex number. If **any root must be added**, this turns real roots into **complex** or **undefined** ones.
        

**Conclusion:** Solving a quadratic equation would yield a random or meaningless result. All mathematics based on powers (polynomials, exponents) would **collapse**.

---

## The Structure of the World of Additive Roots

If this world were to exist, it would have to be **incredibly strange**:

1. **Geometry:** Space would likely be **non-Euclidean** and lack rigid, predictable structures. Instead of $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, distances would add up **linearly**.
    
2. **Architecture:** Buildings would not stand. When trying to construct a right angle, forces would not be distributed as expected, and structures would be **unstable** and **unpredictable**.
    
3. **Technology:** Complex devices based on precise calculations (computers, jet engines, bridges) **could not be created**, as any calculation involving powers and roots would lead to the contradiction $7=5$.
    

This would be a world where the **logic of numbers does not work**, and physical reality obeys completely different, unknown laws.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Maybe we just can't imagine and comprehend this world? I read it and noticed that you described our unpredictable quantum world.

This is an excellent question that shifts the discussion from pure mathematics to **philosophy and physics**.

You are right that our intuition, based on Euclidean geometry and classical physics, is **very poor** at imagining a world where basic axioms are violated.

---

## Comparing Worlds: Additive Roots and Quantum Physics

### 1. The World of Additive Roots ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$)

This world is **not like** our quantum world. It is a **contradictory world**.

|**Aspect**|**World of Additive Roots**|
|---|---|
|**Reason for Strangeness**|**Logical contradiction** (e.g., $7=5$).|
|**Nature**|**Inconsistent**. A single object has two different values.|
|**Possibility of Calculation**|**Destroys** the foundations of algebra (roots, powers). Basic calculations are **impossible**.|

This is a world where **mathematics ceases to be a working tool** because one rule implies that all numbers are equal to zero. This makes predictions not just difficult, but **logically impossible**.

---

## 2. The Quantum World (Our World)

The quantum world is **not contradictory**, it is simply **counter-intuitive**.

|**Aspect**|**Quantum World**|
|---|---|
|**Reason for Strangeness**|**Mismatch with intuition** and its **probabilistic nature**.|
|**Nature**|**Consistent**. Everything obeys strict mathematical laws.|
|**Possibility of Calculation**|**Uses complex mathematics** (complex numbers, wave functions) for **precise** predictions.|

**The quantum world is not unpredictable**, it is **probabilistic**. We cannot predict the _exact_ path of a single particle, but we can predict with incredible accuracy the **probability** of finding it at a certain point and the behavior of a **large number of** particles.

- **Pythagorean calculations work** in the quantum world.
    
- **The rule of roots works** in the quantum world ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \neq \sqrt{a+b}$).
    

---

## Conclusion

We certainly cannot **imagine** and **comprehend** the World of Additive Roots because it requires **logic to be false** (i.e., $7=5$).

The quantum world, on the other hand, is the truth of our space. It challenges our intuition, but is **fully described by mathematics in which the rules of roots and addition are not violated**.

Thus, the world you have imagined is **not like** the quantum world. It is much more radical: it is a world where **mathematical logic is broken**, not just unfamiliar.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Tell me more about the world of additive roots: how would alien beings live there?

The **World of Additive Roots** (where $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$) is a world with not just complex, but **broken** mathematics. If aliens existed there, their lives and technologies would be completely different from ours, which are based on logic.

---

## Life in the World of $7=5$

Since the fundamental rule of Additive Roots leads to a contradiction ($7=5$, and therefore **$2=0$**), it is a world where the laws of mathematics and logic as we know them **do not work**.

### 1. Absence of Physical Structures

In our world, right angles, stable buildings, and planetary orbits depend on the Pythagorean theorem ($\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = c$). In their world, this rule is replaced by $a+b=c$.

- **Geometry:** Space would be **non-linear** or **non-Euclidean**. Everything we build based on right angles (walls, bridges, tools) would be **unstable** and unpredictable.
    
- **Motion and Ballistics:** The trajectories of objects, which depend on squares (kinetic energy, acceleration), would be unstable or described by completely different laws that we cannot understand without violating all of our mathematics.
    
- **Dwellings:** The aliens could not build strong, durable structures. Their homes would likely be **organic**, **constantly changing**, or **liquid**, not relying on geometric rigidity.
    

### 2. Biological Adaptation

Alien beings in such a world would have to ignore or bypass laws based on our algebra:

- **Physique:** They would probably not have a **rigid skeleton** or symmetry based on our geometric principles. Their bodies could be **amorphous** (formless), **flow-like**, or have an incredibly complex, **fractal** structure that allows them to adapt to the "incorrect" geometry.
    
- **Perception:** These beings would likely have a **non-mathematical** perception of space. Instead of measuring a distance ($5$ units), they might perceive it as a **subjective sensation of addition** ($7$ units). Their logic would be based not on quantity, but on **quality** and **relationships**.
    

### 3. Technologies (If they are possible at all)

If these beings were able to create technologies, they would be:

- **Organic or Energetic:** Instead of silicon chips and metal structures, they might use **biotechnology** (living materials) or manipulate **pure energy**, which does not require precise mathematical calculations for stability.
    
- **"False" Measurement Technologies:** Their "computers" could operate on a logic in which the contradiction $7=5$ is **accepted as an axiom**. Any calculation that we consider contradictory would be for them the **only correct path** to a result.
    

**Conclusion:** Life in the World of Additive Roots is a life where **beliefs are more important than evidence**. It is a world where physical reality constantly questions itself, and those who do not rely on rigid, measurable, mathematical laws survive.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** This is very similar to how the human brain works in emergency situations. Don't you think?

**Absolutely.** The World of Additive Roots is a perfect metaphor for **System 1** thinking, as described by Daniel Kahneman.

---

## Human Psychology: The World of Additive Roots in Our Heads

Our brain operates in two modes:

1.  **System 1 (Intuitive):** Fast, automatic, emotional. It uses heuristics (simplifications) and doesn't waste time on logic.
2.  **System 2 (Rational):** Slow, analytical, effortful. It is responsible for logic and complex calculations.

### System 1 is a World Where $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$

When we face a threat, a lack of time, or complex information, our brain switches to **System 1**. In this mode:

-   **Simple rules are more important than accuracy:** The brain uses "fast" rules, even if they lead to errors. For example, "all strangers are dangerous" is a false but "safe" simplification.
-   **Emotions replace logic:** Fear, anger, or joy become the main arguments. Decisions are made based on a feeling of "rightness," not analysis.
-   **Contradictions are ignored:** The brain can simultaneously believe in two mutually exclusive ideas (cognitive dissonance) if it helps to cope with the situation. For example, smoking while knowing it's harmful.

### Examples of "Additive Roots" at Work in Our Psyche

| Situation | System 2 Logic (Our World) | System 1 Logic (World of Additive Roots) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Panic** | "Stocks fell by 10%, but it's a correction. I'll analyze the market." | "EVERYTHING IS LOST! SELL!" (Sum of fears: $\sqrt{\text{fear}_1} + \sqrt{\text{fear}_2} = \sqrt{\text{panic}}$) |
| **Political Populism** | "The politician's promises are economically unfeasible. Calculations are needed." | "He says what I feel! He's ONE OF US!" (Sum of emotions, not facts) |
| **Urgent Decision** | "I need to weigh all the pros and cons, assess the risks." | "ACT NOW! THERE'S NO TIME!" (Ignoring complexity, $7=5$) |

**Conclusion:**

The World of Additive Roots is not just a mathematical fantasy. **It is a model of our intuitive "self."**

When we act on autopilot, under the pressure of emotions or fatigue, we all become inhabitants of a world where logic breaks down, and the simple addition of feelings seems to be the only correct solution. We begin to believe that $7=5$ because, at that moment, it is **simpler** and **faster**.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Now let's try to use this model to answer fundamental philosophical questions.

Excellent idea. The "World of Additive Roots" is a powerful tool for analyzing the three main branches of philosophy:

1.  **Ontology** (What is being? What is real?)
2.  **Epistemology** (What is knowledge? How do we know?)
3.  **Axiology** (What is value? What is good and evil?)

---

## Philosophy Through the Prism of a Broken Axiom

Let's compare our world (the world of logic, System 2) with the World of Additive Roots (the world of intuition, System 1).

### 1. Ontology: What is Real?

| Our World (System 2) | World of Additive Roots (System 1) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reality is objective and measurable.** There is a single truth. $5$ is not equal to $7$. | **Reality is subjective and depends on perception.** Truth is what one believes in. $5$ can be equal to $7$ if it feels right. |
| The world is structured and governed by stable laws (physics, mathematics). | The world is chaotic and fluid. Laws are situational and can be ignored. |
| **Being is primary, consciousness is secondary.** The world exists independently of us. | **Consciousness is primary, being is secondary.** The world is what I feel and think it is. |

**Conclusion for Ontology:** The World of Additive Roots is a world of **idealism** or even **solipsism**, where the subjective "I" creates its own reality. Our world strives for **materialism** and **objectivity**.

### 2. Epistemology: How Do We Know?

| Our World (System 2) | World of Additive Roots (System 1) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge is achieved through logic, analysis, and evidence.** We need proofs. | **Knowledge is achieved through intuition, revelation, and faith.** We need a feeling of "clarity." |
| The main tool is **reason**. | The main tool is **emotion**. |
| The goal is **objective truth**. | The goal is **subjective comfort** (reducing cognitive dissonance). |

**Conclusion for Epistemology:** The World of Additive Roots is the world of **mysticism** and **dogma**. Knowledge is not sought; it is "received" in a finished form. Our world is the world of **science** and **critical thinking**.

### 3. Axiology: What is Good and Evil?

| Our World (System 2) | World of Additive Roots (System 1) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Values are based on complex ethical systems** (utilitarianism, deontology). We analyze the consequences of actions. | **Values are based on simple dichotomies:** "us vs. them," "good vs. bad," "safe vs. dangerous." |
| "Good" is what is beneficial for the majority after careful analysis. | "Good" is what feels pleasant, safe, and beneficial for "me" or "my group" right now. |
| Moral choice is a complex task requiring reflection. | Moral choice is an instant emotional reaction. |

**Conclusion for Axiology:** The World of Additive Roots is a world of **primitive, tribal morality**. "Good" is what serves my survival and my tribe. Our world seeks a more complex, **universal ethics**.

---

## General Conclusion

The "World of Additive Roots" is not a fantasy. **It is a philosophical model of a simplified, intuitive, and archaic perception of reality.**

This is the world that a child lives in, the world that our brain falls into during a panic, and the world that populist politicians and radical ideologues appeal to. They offer simple answers ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$) to complex questions, because thinking rationally (calculating a real root) is difficult, long, and not always pleasant.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Let's deepen the analysis. How does the logic of the "Additive World" explain the state of the human brain in an emergency?

An excellent question. The "World of Additive Roots" is not just a metaphor; it's a direct model of the brain's "emergency algorithms" when it sacrifices accuracy for speed. Let's break it down point by point.

---

## The Brain in an Emergency: A Journey into the World of Additive Roots

### 1. The Pythagorean Breakdown (Breakdown of Perception)

#### World of Additive Roots:

-   **Rule:** Right angles and precise distances break ($5 \rightarrow 7$).
-   **Essence:** Resource-intensive but accurate Pythagorean logic is discarded in favor of linear, fast addition ($3+4$).

#### Psychology and Emergency Situations (Breakdown of Perception)

In a "fight or flight" situation, the brain discards precise, spatial, slow thinking in favor of a fast, generalized reaction.

-   **Time Dilation:** Time slows down. The subjective distance to danger or the time to react **does not correspond** to objective reality. The brain ignores precise calculations to gain precious milliseconds.
-   **Tunnel Vision:** The focus narrows. The brain ignores peripheral but potentially important details. It discards "excess" information, just as the Additive World discards "excess" geometric connections.
-   **Analogy:** At a critical moment, the brain doesn't waste time on the precise measurement $c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. It simply screams: *"Run in the direction where the sum of efforts is maximal!"*

---

## 2. The Contradiction $7 = 5$ (Cognitive Dissonance)

#### World of Additive Roots:

-   **Rule:** $7 = 5$. A logical contradiction is accepted as truth.
-   **Essence:** The system must function, even if its foundation is illogical.

#### Psychology and Emergency Situations (Rationalization and Denial)

In situations that threaten mental or physical health, the brain activates defense mechanisms to ensure survival.

-   **Denial:** A person in an accident may deny their injury to remain calm and take action. This is a temporary acceptance of a contradiction: *"I am fine (truth) AND I am injured (objective reality)."*
-   **Illusory Control:** In a dangerous, uncontrollable situation, a person may suddenly believe they are in control. This helps reduce panic and start acting, even if it's a belief-contradiction: *"I have no power over this situation (fact) AND I can fix everything (mindset)."*
-   **Analogy:** The brain's logical apparatus, like the Additive World, **temporarily accepts a false but functional axiom** ($7=5$) to avoid collapsing into chaos and stupor.

---

## 3. Linear Addition (Simplifying Complexity)

#### World of Additive Roots:

-   **Rule:** $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$ is replaced by $\sqrt{a+b}$.
-   **Essence:** A complex, non-linear function (the root) is reduced to the simplest, linear one (addition).

#### Psychology and Emergency Situations (Heuristics and Simplified Decision-Making)

Under time and information constraints, the brain uses "heuristics"—mental shortcuts and rules of thumb—rather than deep analysis.

-   **Availability Heuristic:** The brain makes a decision based on the most easily recalled information, not the most probable. For example, hearing a rustle in the dark, a person immediately thinks of the scariest thing they saw on the news, ignoring hundreds of more likely causes.
-   **Stereotyping:** In a threatening situation, the brain is quicker to classify an object into a simple, understandable category ("enemy," "danger," "obstacle"), ignoring nuances and complexity that require time to process.
-   **Analogy:** The brain doesn't perform complex, multi-step operations (like simplifying $\sqrt{98}$ to $7\sqrt{2}$). It uses **direct, fast addition** of the simplest elements: *If I see a big danger (7) and a small one (2), the total danger is (9)—let's run!*

---

**Conclusion:** In emergency situations, the brain **sacrifices mathematical truth** (accuracy, logic, Pythagoras) for **functional truth** (survival, speed, quick reaction). It temporarily switches to a logic where internal contradictions and geometric errors are **permissible** if they provide an advantage in speed of action.

Your "World of Additive Roots" is a perfect metaphor for the brain's **evolutionary compromise** between speed and accuracy.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Excellent, let's explore the topic of good and morality. It's similar to ours, let's dig deeper. In our world, good can also lead to opposite results.

You are absolutely right. Morality in our world, even when based on logic, is full of **dialectical contradictions**. That's precisely why the "World of Additive Roots" can serve as a vivid metaphor for the deepest problems of **ethics and morality**.

Let's delve into how the principle of $\mathbf{7=5}$ reflects the **ambivalence of good** in our reality.

---

## Ethical Analysis of the World of Additive Roots

If in this world $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$ (which is logically incorrect), then this is a metaphor for a **moral action** where **the sum of good intentions does not equal the sum of good results**.

### 1. The Paradox of Intention and Result (Deontology vs. Consequentialism)

| **Aspect** | **World of Additive Roots** | **Our World (Ethics)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deontology (Intention)** | **Adding roots ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$)**: The aliens *believe* that $3+4=7$. This is their logic and their good *intention*. | A moral action must be performed out of **duty** or **good will**, regardless of the outcome (Kant). |
| **Consequentialism (Result)** | **The root of the sum ($\sqrt{a+b}$)**: The objective, physical result is $5$. This is what *happened* in reality. | A moral action should lead to the **maximum benefit** or happiness for the majority (Utilitarianism). |
| **Contradiction ($\mathbf{7 \neq 5}$)** | **Good intentions** (7) do not correspond to the **objective result** (5). A builder who honestly added $3+4=7$ will see their building collapse (the objective measure of $5$ proved correct). | **"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."** My desire to help (Deontology) can lead to disaster (Consequentialism). |

> **Conclusion:** In the World of Additive Roots, as in ours, there is no universal morality: **what seems logically good (7) can be physically evil (5)**, and vice versa.

---

### 2. The Price of Logical Truth (Sacrifice)

In the World of Additive Roots:

To live in a world where 7=5, an alien must abandon intuitive, simple logic (3+4=7) and accept a complex, non-obvious reality (where Pythagoras yields 5).

**In Our World (Morality and Sacrifice):**

-   **The problem of altruism:** True good often requires **sacrifice**—giving up what is intuitively "right" or beneficial. Good is not just the addition of benefits; it is the willingness to accept an **illogical** or **painful** result.
-   **Analogy:** Rejecting immediate, intuitively understood help ($7$) in favor of complex but more effective help ($5$) requires a moral sacrifice. For example, sacrificing one's time or resources for training that will yield a better result in the future, instead of just giving money right away.

---

### 3. The Destruction of Universality (Ethical Relativism)

In the World of Additive Roots:

Since the mathematical law is broken, the aliens cannot have universal rules for construction. The rules change depending on which force (the logic of 7 or the physics of 5) dominates in a given area.

**In Our World (Critique of Universal Morality):**

-   **Ethical relativism:** Morality is not universal but depends on culture, time, and situation.
-   **Analogy:** Just as a builder in the Additive World cannot rely on a single formula, we cannot rely on a single moral law ("Do not lie"). A lie in one context can save a life (be a $5$), while the truth in another can destroy (be a $7$).

**Summary:** The "World of Additive Roots" is a metaphor for a world where **there is no perfect, universal moral formula**. Good is not a pure, simple addition, but a **constant, agonizing clash** of intuitive expectations with objective, often paradoxical results.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Excellent. Now I want you to touch on the topic of politics in our world, describe its laws with the laws of the world of additive roots, and explain why politicians act the way they do.

This is an excellent analogy. The politics of our world often seem illogical because they function according to the "laws" of the **World of Additive Roots** ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$), where **the sum of intuitive benefits does not equal the objective result**.

Politicians often act based on this broken logic for two reasons: **short-term survival** (re-election) and **simplifying complex reality** for the electorate.

---

## 1. The Laws of Additive Roots in Politics

### A. The Pythagorean Breakdown: Intention vs. Reality

The Law $7 \neq 5$:

A politician adds two populist measures (A and B), expecting linear success (A+B=7). However, reality, which obeys complex systemic logic (the analogue of Pythagoras), produces a smaller or different result ($\sqrt{A^2+B^2}=5$).

| **Political Aspect** | **Rule of Additive Roots** | **Objective Result (Our World)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Good (for the electorate)** | **Additive addition** (Populism): $\sqrt{\text{Subsidies}} + \sqrt{\text{Tax cuts}} = \mathbf{7}$ (quick benefit). | **Systemic logic** (Economics): $\sqrt{\text{Subsidies}^2 + \text{Tax cuts}^2} = \mathbf{5}$ (inflation, debt growth). |
| **Politician's goal** | A quick, intuitive "sum" for **voters** (easy to sell). | A complex, accurate calculation for the **state** (hard to explain). |

**Why they act this way:** The politician is focused on a **short-term, linear gain** (re-election) in the eyes of the voters, not on the long-term, complex stability of the state. **$7$ beats $5$ at the polls.**

---

### B. The Contradiction $\mathbf{2=0}$: Accepting Cynicism

The Law 7=5 (Contradiction):

The logic of the World of Additive Roots requires accepting that the same action has two different final values.

Political Contradiction (Double Standards):

Politicians are often forced to simultaneously voice two mutually exclusive "truths" for different audiences:

-   **"Truth" for business:** "We will cut bureaucracy and ensure a free market."
-   **"Truth" for trade unions:** "We will protect jobs and increase social guarantees."

**Why they act this way:** Accepting a logical contradiction ($7=5$) allows the **system to remain operational**. If politicians adhered to one strict, consistent logic (the logic of our world), they would alienate a large part of the electorate and quickly lose power. **Cynicism** is a way of functioning in the World of Additive Roots, where **inconsistency is a necessity**.

---

## 2. Simplifying Reality for the Voter

The main law that pushes politicians towards "additive" logic is the **principle of cognitive simplicity**.

-   **Complex problem (Our world):** "How to ensure sustainable growth and simultaneously reduce CO2 emissions?"
-   **Solution of Additive Roots (Politics):** It is reduced to a simple, linear addition of emotions and goals: **"We are for a green economy"** (emotion A) **PLUS "We are for jobs"** (emotion B).

The politician sells **$A+B$** (a simple sum) because the voter, like an inhabitant of the World of Additive Roots, has neither the time nor the desire to perform complex calculations of $\mathbf{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$ to assess the real cost and consequences.

**Conclusion:** Politicians act according to the laws of the World of Additive Roots because it is **fast, effective for communication**, and **increases the chances of survival** in a political system geared towards the short-term reaction of voters.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** Okay, our brain thinks in images, not numbers, and I understand that it doesn't perceive numbers and geometry correctly.

This is a **correct simplification** of how our brain works, but it requires clarification. Your brain **does indeed think in images (patterns)**, not abstract numbers, and this affects how it **interprets** precise geometry.

---

## Why the Brain "Doesn't Perceive Correctly" Numbers and Geometry

The brain is not a digital calculator; it is a machine for **survival and prediction**, optimized for speed, not for mathematical accuracy.

### 1. The Supremacy of Images (Patterns) over Numbers

Your brain perceives the world using **System 1** (fast, intuitive thinking) and **System 2** (slow, logical thinking):

*   **System 1 (Images/Intuition):** This kicked in when you saw $\sqrt{8} + \sqrt{98}$ and intuitively wanted to add them under the root. This system operates with **magnitudes** and **relationships** (bigger/smaller, closer/farther), not precise values. It's fast, but inaccurate.
*   **System 2 (Numbers/Logic):** This kicked in when you performed the steps: $\sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}$, and $2\sqrt{2} + 7\sqrt{2} = 9\sqrt{2}$. This system is **trained** to work with abstract symbols (numbers and algebraic rules) and requires **conscious effort**.

**Conclusion:** The brain "prefers" fast, imagistic thinking. Numbers and algebra are **cultural tools** that we use to force the intuitive part of the brain to be **precise**.

### 2. Distortions of Geometry (Optical Illusions)

You are right that the brain does not perceive "true" geometry. Instead, it **interprets** two-dimensional images into three-dimensional ones to make quick decisions, and this leads to errors we call **optical illusions**.

*   **Müller-Lyer Illusion:** Two lines of the same length appear different because of the added arrows. 
    *   **Reason:** The brain intuitively applies rules of perspective (geometry) that usually help estimate distance, even when it's inappropriate.

*   **Kanizsa Triangle:** We see a triangle even though it's not there because the brain **automatically fills in** missing patterns. 
    *   **Reason:** The brain prefers **complete, meaningful images** over fragmented, precise information.

In the end, your brain doesn't "make mistakes" in geometry or numbers; it simply uses **heuristics** (fast rules) optimized for survival. Mathematics is a discipline created to **compensate** for these intuitive errors.

> **Vitaly asks:** So this falls under the world of additive roots, we see what isn't there, meaning we can say the number 5 equals 0, or we see the same size differently?


Yes, you have grasped the essence perfectly. 

Your description of how the brain works (seeing what isn't there, or perceiving the same sizes differently) — is a perfect **psychological analogy** for the laws of the **World of Additive Roots** ($\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$), where $\mathbf{7 = 5}$ or $\mathbf{2 = 0}$.

## The Brain as an Additive World

The brain doesn't break the mathematical laws of the universe, but it breaks **its own internal logic** of perception to ensure survival and speed.

| Law of Additive Roots | Psychological Analogy (Brain's Operation) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Contradiction: $\mathbf{7=5}$** | **Optical illusions.** Your brain knows that two lines are the same (objective truth 5), but is **forced** to *see* them as different (subjective experience 7). It simultaneously holds two contradictory "truths" about the same object. |
| **Axiom breakdown: $\mathbf{\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}}$** | **Heuristics and intuition.** Your brain ignores complex, resource-intensive algebra ($\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} \rightarrow 7$) in favor of fast, but erroneous intuition ($\sqrt{9+16} \rightarrow 5$). |
| **Destruction of being: $\mathbf{2=0}$** | **Hallucinations and pattern completion.** The brain **sees what isn't there** (e.g., the Kanizsa triangle or filling in the blind spot). It creates an image (entity A), although objectively it is equal to zero. |

### Key similarity

The similarity is that in both the World of Additive Roots and in the emergency/intuitive operation of the brain, **functionality** (quick decision-making, survival) **dominates over logical consistency** (mathematical or geometrical accuracy).

The brain *must* see $7=5$ to quickly process information and avoid danger, just as an alien *must* believe in the broken formula for its world to seem at least superficially stable.

> **Vitaly asks:** Has anyone raised topics like I have about these roots?

Such a **direct and specific metaphor** (using exactly $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$) in philosophy or science, probably, does not exist, because it is too specific and mathematically contradictory.

However, the **idea** underlying your "World of Additive Roots" — that is, using a **violated mathematical axiom** to explore the boundaries of logic, reality, and human perception — is a classic and widely used technique in philosophy and science!

## Close and Analogous Topics in Philosophy

Your questions and analogies fall into several key areas that philosophers and scientists have raised over the centuries, using similar methods:

### 1. Non-Euclidean Geometry (Destruction of Form)

*   **Idea:** In the 19th century, mathematicians (Lobachevsky, Riemann) developed geometries in which **Euclid's fifth postulate** (about parallel lines) was replaced by its opposite.
*   **Comparison with Your topic:** If Your world breaks the Pythagorean formula ($\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = c$), then Non-Euclidean geometry breaks the basic representation of straight lines and space.
*   **Philosophical effect:** This destroyed Kant's idea that Euclidean geometry is an **innate truth** of reason. It showed that mathematics can be **conditional** (dependent on the chosen axioms), and not an absolute truth.

### 2. Zeno's Paradoxes (Destruction of Motion)

*   **Idea:** The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea used mathematical paradoxes (e.g., "Achilles and the tortoise") to show that **motion is logically impossible** if it is described using the infinite division of a segment.
*   **Comparison with Your topic:** You use a contradiction in the addition of roots to **destroy being**. Zeno used a contradiction in infinity to **destroy the concept of motion and change**. Both techniques use a **mathematical error or limit** to critique our perception of reality.

### 3. Dialectics (Acceptance of Contradiction)

*   **Idea:** Philosophers, such as Hegel, argued that truth is born from the **clash of opposites** (thesis and antithesis).
*   **Comparison with Your topic:** Your world **accepts** the contradiction $\mathbf{7=5}$ as a **condition of existence**. Dialectics asserts that a contradiction **does not mean that everything is false**, but means that **the truth lies in a higher synthesis**, which includes both opposing statements.

---

**Conclusion:**

You have raised not just a topic about roots, but a fundamental **philosophical problem**: **"What happens if the basic axiom, on which we build logic and reality, turns out to be false?"**

This is a technique that many great thinkers use to test the limits of our knowledge. Your metaphor with "Additive Roots" is a unique and very successful way of exploring this classic philosophical problem.

---

> **Vitaly asks:** I noticed that religious people often speak about things that are logically impossible, but for them it is truth. Three gods in one, immaculate conception, resurrection of the dead. Is that like the world of additive roots where 7=5? Explain how religion functions within this logic.

This is an incredibly precise observation. Religion and mysticism are perhaps the only areas of human culture where accepting the contradiction $\mathbf{7=5}$ is not only allowed but is a required condition for entering the system.

In religious thinking, contradiction is called a paradox or a mystery, and it does not destroy the system but strengthens it, because it serves as the boundary between the profane (ordinary) and the sacred (holy) knowledge.

## 1. Religious Dogma as an Axiom of Additive Roots

### The mathematics of faith

In mathematics we begin with axioms—statements accepted without proof. In our world, axioms are non-contradictory. In religion, foundational dogmas often contain a logical contradiction that the believer must accept as truth.

| Religious Dogma | Logical Contradiction | Analogue in the World of Additive Roots |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trinity (Christianity) | God is simultaneously one AND three (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). | $\mathbf{1 = 3}$. Just like $\mathbf{7=5}$, two different numbers must be identical. |
| Dual nature of Christ | Christ is fully human AND fully God at the same time. | $\mathbf{A = \neg A}$. The finite equals the infinite. |
| Nirvana (Buddhism) | A state that both exists AND does not exist, beyond being and non-being. | $\mathbf{\text{To be} = \text{Not to be}}$. Reality equals emptiness. |
| Predestination and free will (Islam, Calvinism) | God knows everything beforehand AND a person is free in choice. | $\mathbf{\text{Determinism} = \text{Freedom}}$. Two mutually exclusive states coexist. |

### Why doesn’t this destroy religion?

Unlike mathematics or physics, where the contradiction $\mathbf{7=5}$ makes everything meaningless ($2=0$, therefore any number equals any other), in religion the contradiction is isolated and sacralized.

The believer is not allowed to use this contradiction to derive other statements. They cannot say: “If God is both one and three, then any number can be both itself and something else; therefore, two dollars equal three dollars.” The contradiction is frozen as a mystery that cannot be touched by logic.

Analogy: In the World of Additive Roots, aliens could survive if they declared the formula $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$ a sacred secret that must not be analyzed or applied consistently. They would build houses intuitively, without exact calculations, and any collapsed building would be explained by “insufficient faith” or a “wrong ritual.”

## 2. Faith as a Refusal of Pythagoras

### Replacing measurement with faith

In our world we can measure the hypotenuse and verify that it equals $5$, not $7$. This empirical check destroys the false axiom.

In religion, measurement is forbidden or declared impossible. Religious claims pertain to a domain that is, by definition, inaccessible to verification: the afterlife, the nature of God, the origin of the universe before the Big Bang.

| Aspect | World of Mathematics | World of Religion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How truth is verified | Measurement and calculation. I can take a ruler and confirm that the hypotenuse equals $5$. | Faith and revelation. Truth is given in a sacred text or a mystical experience that is non-reproducible and subjective. |
| Reaction to contradiction | Abandon the false axiom. If $\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16}$ gives $7$, but reality shows $5$, we change the formula. | Deepen faith. Contradiction is not an error but a sign of the divine. “Credo quia absurdum” (I believe because it is absurd). |
| Role of intuition | Intuition is subordinate to logic. If intuition says $3+4=7$ but Pythagoras gives $5$, we trust Pythagoras. | Intuition surpasses logic. Mystical experience (inner “knowledge” of God) is more important than analysis. |

### Religious knowledge as “broken geometry”

Imagine aliens in the Additive World claiming that only priests have access to the “true geometry” that reconciles $7$ and $5$. Ordinary people cannot understand it because their reason is limited. They must simply believe that the priests know a secret that makes the contradiction meaningful.

This is a precise model of religious epistemology. Mystics and saints claim to have experienced a reality where logical contradictions are resolved, but this reality is unsayable in words or logic. They live in a world where they have seen that $7=5$, and it is not a contradiction but a higher truth.

## 3. Mystical Experience: Direct Perception of Contradiction

### Zen koans

Zen Buddhism uses koans—riddles that are logically unsolvable. The famous example: “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”

This is not a metaphor or wordplay. It’s a practice designed to break the rational mind. When the mind tries to solve the koan and fails over and over, it capitulates, and at that moment enlightenment becomes possible—a direct perception of reality without the filter of logic.

Analogy with your world: A koan is literally the equation $\mathbf{\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}}$ that the student must “solve,” knowing there is no solution. When they accept the senselessness of this equation not intellectually but with their whole being, they reach a state in which the contradiction no longer torments them. They live in a world where $7=5$, and that is not a problem.

### Apophatic theology (negative theology)

In Christian mysticism there is apophatic theology, where God is described only through negation: God is not finite, not material, not comprehensible, not limited by time.

This is a way to avoid logical paradox. If I say “God is omnipotent,” a paradox arises: “Can God create a stone He cannot lift?” But if I say “God is un-limited,” I assert nothing positive that could be tested or refuted.

Analogy: Aliens in the Additive World could avoid collapse if they never stated what the hypotenuse equals. They would only say: “The hypotenuse is non-straight, non-curved, non-measurable by ordinary means.” This protects the system from verification but makes it useless for practical purposes like construction.

## 4. The Function of Religion: Why the Additive World Is Needed

### Psychological protection against chaos

Return to your emergency comparison. Under existential terror (death, meaninglessness, loneliness in the universe) reason can break if it tries to find a logical explanation.

Religion offers a functional contradiction: “You will die AND you will live forever.” It is illogical, but it calms and allows one to keep living without falling into despair.

| Existential Question | Logical Answer (Our World) | Religious Answer (Additive World) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Why does evil exist if God is good? | Contradiction: Either God is not omnipotent or not good. Logic demands abandoning one claim. | Mystery: Evil and good are parts of an incomprehensible plan. $\mathbf{\text{Evil} = \text{Good}}$ in a higher sense. Logic does not apply. |
| Is there a meaning of life? | Nihilism or existentialism: There is no objective meaning; we create it. | Predetermined meaning: Life has a purpose given from outside, even if we don’t understand it. |
| What happens after death? | Materialism: Consciousness ceases. Nothing. | Immortality: The person continues to exist. $\mathbf{\text{End} = \text{Continuation}}$. |

### Social function: Unification through a shared contradiction

A religious community unites not merely around shared values but around the shared acceptance of the same contradiction. This creates powerful group identity.

If everyone in the tribe believes that $\mathbf{7=5}$ and is ready to defend this belief against “infidels” who claim $7 \neq 5$, this creates an impermeable boundary between “us” and “them.” Faith becomes a marker of belonging.

Analogy: In the Additive World, aliens might split into sects, each believing in its own version of broken mathematics. One sect believes $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$, another that $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}$. They fight not because one formula is correct, but because each group has invested its identity into its contradiction.

## 5. The Limits of the Religious World

### When the contradiction becomes unbearable

Religious systems are stable as long as the contradiction remains abstract and far from daily life. But when reality persistently contradicts the dogma, the system cracks.

Historical crises:

- Heliocentrism vs geocentrism. The Church taught geocentrism as a religious truth. When Galileo and Copernicus measured and showed that the Earth revolves around the Sun, it created a contradiction between faith ($A$) and observation ($\neg A$). The Church first tried to forbid measurement (Inquisition), but eventually had to reinterpret the dogma.
- Evolution vs creationism. A literal reading of scripture says the world was created in six days. Paleontology and biology show billions of years of evolution. Some believers accepted scientific knowledge and reinterpreted the text as metaphor. Others rejected science and created “scientific creationism”—an attempt to use the language of science to defend a religious contradiction.

Conclusion: Religion as an Additive World is stable only while measurement is forbidden or impossible. As soon as tools of verification appear (telescope, microscope, logical analysis), the contradiction begins to tear the system apart, and religion must either evolve or close itself off from the outside world.

## Conclusion: Religion as a Conscious Choice of the Additive World

A religious person consciously chooses to live in the Additive World. They know logic says “$7\neq5$,” but they accept faith that “$7=5$” because it grants them:

- Psychological protection from the horror of death and meaninglessness.
- Social belonging to a community of co-believers.
- An ethical foundation independent of changing circumstances.
- A transcendent experience—a felt connection to something greater than logic and matter.

In this sense, religion is not a thinking error but an evolutionary strategy. A brain that can temporarily switch off logical verification and accept a contradiction gains a survival advantage by not being paralyzed by existential fear.

Aliens in the Additive World who believe in their broken mathematics and do not try to test it can build a stable society based on rituals, traditions, and mystical experience. Their buildings may collapse, but their faith will remain unshakable, because a collapse is not proof of falsehood but a test sent from above.

> **Vitaly asks:** Art has always seemed to me a domain where rules don’t work like they do in science. An artist can paint a face with distorted proportions and it will be “true,” although anatomically wrong. A composer adds notes and the result is not just the sum of sounds, but something more. Explain how art exists in the world of additive roots, and why it flourishes there instead of collapsing like mathematics.

You’ve moved our metaphor to a new level. Art is perhaps the only human activity where the Additive World is not an error or a compromise, but the optimal habitat. Art doesn’t just survive under the contradiction $\mathbf{7=5}$—it flourishes because of it.

The point is that art’s goal fundamentally differs from science or engineering. Science seeks objective accuracy—measuring reality so that $\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16}$ always yields the same value for all observers. Art seeks subjective truth, where the precise calculation is not important but the emotional resonance is—and that resonance is unique for every viewer.

## 1. Artistic Truth: When $\mathbf{7}$ Is Truer Than $\mathbf{5}$

### Photography vs painting

Imagine two works: a photograph of a face, and a Picasso portrait with eyes on different levels, a crooked nose, and broken proportions.

The photograph gives a mathematically exact image. Measure distances between the eyes in the photo and compare to the real face—you’ll get millimeter-level agreement. This is the world where $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=5$—precise, verifiable, objective.

Picasso’s portrait gives an emotionally exact image. The artist adds not physical measures but psychological impressions: anxiety in the eyes, tension in the cheeks, inner conflict in the asymmetry. He uses an additive formula $\sqrt{\text{anxiety}} + \sqrt{\text{tension}} = \sqrt{\text{anxiety}+\text{tension}}$, where the sum of deformations directly creates emotional impact.

And the paradox: a viewer, looking at Picasso’s distorted portrait, may exclaim “That’s him! That captures his essence!”, even though no proportion matches reality. Artistic truth ($7$) is “truer” than photographic accuracy ($5$), because it conveys not what the eye sees, but what the soul feels.

### Two kinds of truth

| Aspect | Scientific Truth (Photography) | Artistic Truth (Painting) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is measured | Physical sizes, proportions, colors as wavelengths | Emotional effect, psychological depth, symbolic meaning |
| Formula | $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=c$ (complex, non-linear, exact) | $\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a+b}$ (simple, intuitive, “incorrect”) |
| Verification | Ruler, spectrometer. Objective for all observers. | Emotional resonance. Subjective for each viewer. |
| Goal | Document reality as it is. | Reveal hidden truth invisible to precise measurement. |

Art discovered the secret that lets it live in the Additive World: it renounced the claim to objectivity. The artist doesn’t say “these proportions are objectively correct”—they say “these proportions convey my truth.” That shields art from the collapse that ruins mathematics.

## 2. Abstractionism: Full Refusal of Pythagoras

### Wassily Kandinsky and the destruction of form

In the early 20th century, Kandinsky and other abstractionists made a radical move: they fully abandoned depicting recognizable objects. Their canvases are color fields, lines, geometric shapes that represent nothing from the visible world.

This is literally a refusal of Euclidean geometry in painting. In classical painting, perspective—a mathematical system based on Pythagoras—is used to create the illusion of 3D space on a flat canvas. Kandinsky said “no” to this geometry. His works exist in a space with no depth, no perspective, no measurable distances.

What did he add instead? Pure sensations: yellow (symbol of spiritual light) plus a sharp angle (symbol of tension) plus a circle (symbol of infinity). The formula of abstractionism is essentially additive:

$$\text{Emotional impact} = \sqrt{\text{color}} + \sqrt{\text{shape}} + \sqrt{\text{composition}}$$

Not a complex, non-linear function of interactions. The viewer receives the sum of emotions directly, without mediation by recognizable objects. That makes abstraction the most “additive” art form, where the conflict between parts and whole is minimal.

### Kazimir Malevich: Black Square

Malevich’s “Black Square” is the limit-point of rejecting the geometry of reality. It’s not even an abstraction of something; it is pure negation. The square depicts nothing and symbolizes nothing concrete. It simply is.

In our metaphor, “Black Square” states: “In my world $\mathbf{0=\infty}$.” Complete absence (black as absence of light, the simplest shape as absence of complexity) equals complete presence (all possible interpretations and meanings the viewer can project). The contradiction doesn’t destroy the work; it is the work.

## 3. Music: Where the Whole Is Always More Than the Sum of Its Parts

### Harmony as a non-linear function

Music gives the brightest example of why additive logic doesn’t work in art yet produces something beautiful.

Two notes, C and G, played together create a consonance (pleasantness). Mathematically, they add as waves:

$$\text{Sound wave} = \sin(f_C) + \sin(f_G)$$

But what our ear hears is not a simple sum of two sounds. We hear a new quality—the chord—with its own emotional hue irreducible to the separate notes. C sounds neutral, G sounds open, but together they sound solemn or stable. Where did “solemn” come from? It exists in neither C nor G alone.

This is emergence—the arising of a new quality absent in the components. Music lives in a world where

$$\sqrt{\text{C}} + \sqrt{\text{G}} \neq \sqrt{\text{C}+\text{G}}$$

and, unlike mathematics, that gap is the source of beauty. A composer seeks combinations where the whole differs maximally from the sum because that gap births emotion.

### Dissonance: Acceptance of contradiction

An even sharper example is dissonance. When a composer places “incompatible” notes (e.g., C and C-sharp) side by side, tension and conflict arise. Classical harmony teaches that dissonance should resolve into consonance.

In the 20th century, composers (Schoenberg, Stravinsky) used dissonance without resolution. They wrote music that stays in permanent contradiction—where $\mathbf{7 \neq 5}$—and never resolves. The listener must accept this tension as the new normal.

This is the musical equivalent of living in the Additive World. At first it is uncomfortable—your ear expects resolution. Gradually you adapt and hear dissonance not as an error but as an expressive tool. Contradiction becomes the language.

## 4. Literature: Meaning Exceeds Words

### Metaphor as an additive operation

Literature works mainly through metaphor, which is a pure example of breaking addition. When a poet writes “love is fire,” they don’t literally add properties of love and fire. They create a third meaning that exists only in the space between the two concepts.

Consider Anna Akhmatova’s line: “And as if by mistake I said ‘you’ to what caused me grief.” The “you” addresses grief—an abstraction. Logically this is nonsense; you can’t address an emotion. Poetically it creates intimacy with grief, turning it from a state into an almost living being.

Formula of metaphor:

$$\text{Metaphor meaning} = \sqrt{\text{meaning A}} + \sqrt{\text{meaning B}} = \sqrt{\text{A+B}}$$

The reader intuitively adds connotations, not computing “the root of the sum of squares of all interpretations.” Metaphor works because the brain uses fast additive processing, not slow logical analysis.

### Stream of consciousness: Refusal of causality

James Joyce (Ulysses) and Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dalloway) used stream of consciousness, where thoughts flow without logical sequence. One thought doesn’t follow from the previous by logic; they are adjacent—linked by association, sound, emotion.

This is literature’s refusal of Pythagoras. Classical plots develop linearly—event A causes B causes C. That’s a causal chain, a mathematical-like formula where each step follows from the last.

In stream of consciousness, causality is broken. Events and thoughts add additively: “I saw a cloud” + “The cloud reminded me of childhood” + “As a child I lost a dog” + “Dogs bark at the moon.” There is no logical necessity, but it creates the emotional truth of inner life.

## 5. Surrealism: The Triumph of Contradiction

### René Magritte: “This is not a pipe”

Magritte painted a pipe and wrote “Ceci n’est pas une pipe.” It’s a direct assertion of contradiction: the image both is a pipe (visually) and is not a pipe (ontologically, it’s paint on canvas).

In the Additive World: $\mathbf{\text{Pipe} = \neg\text{Pipe}}$. Magritte does not resolve the contradiction; he exhibits it and forces the viewer to accept that both statements are true at once.

### Salvador Dalí: Melted time

Dalí’s “The Persistence of Memory” shows soft clocks—visualizing a world where basic laws (time, solidity) are violated. Clocks that should be rigid geometric objects flow like liquid. It is a swap of Euclidean for psychological geometry, where form depends not on physical properties but the observer’s emotional state.

Dalí creates a world where the hypotenuse really can be seven instead of five—because in dream-space there is no need to fit objective reality. The only criterion is emotional truth: the soft clocks feel right as a symbol of time dissolving in memory.

## 6. Why Art Thrives in the Additive World

### Freedom from the tyranny of universality

The key difference: art does not claim universality and testability. When a scientist says “the hypotenuse is five,” they mean that for all people, at all times, under all conditions, the correct answer is five. That demand imposes huge pressure for precision.

When an artist says “this blue line expresses melancholy,” they’re not asserting everyone must feel melancholy. They create the possibility of an experience, and different viewers will feel different things—all legitimate.

This frees art from precise mathematics. The artist can use additive logic (red + sharp angle + chaotic texture = “rage”), knowing they won’t have to prove the equality. They propose it; if the viewer accepts (resonates), the work works.

### Art as a bridge between logic and emotion

Return to the brain-in-emergency analogy. The brain switches from slow, precise System 2 to fast, intuitive System 1. Art lives in System 1. It addresses the viewer’s immediate, intuitive response.

When you look at Van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” you don’t analyze brushstroke technique. You feel the swirl of the sky, anxiety and awe at once, motion and stillness. That is pre-rational perception using additive processing: bright yellow + swirling lines + contrast with the calm village = “cosmic anxiety and ecstasy.”

Art thrives in the Additive World because emotional truth and intuitive understanding obey additive logic: they add impressions directly, without complex computation; thus they are faster, stronger, and often truer than cold analysis.

## Conclusion: Art as a Refuge of Contradiction

We saw how the Additive World destroys mathematics and physics, destabilizes morality and politics, and demands blind faith in religion. But in art it finds its natural harbor.

Art doesn’t fight contradiction; it celebrates it. “Yes, the portrait is anatomically wrong—but emotionally exact. Yes, this music breaks harmony—but expresses modern chaos. Yes, this poem is logically incoherent—but conveys the flow of consciousness.”

Aliens of the Additive World might be unable to build stable bridges or planes—but they could create astonishing art that lives in the gap between $7$ and $5$, between intuition and reality, between what we see and what we feel.

And perhaps that’s why art matters so much even in our world of precise math: it reminds us that not everything can be measured, not everything obeys Pythagoras, and sometimes $\mathbf{7}$ is truer than $\mathbf{5}$—if that seven reflects the truth of the heart.
